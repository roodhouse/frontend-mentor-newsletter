### What I learned

It was good to have more practice with passing props from parent to child and back up. This project allowed me to pass from parent to child to child and then back up. I am gaining more of an understanding of the concept. 

I am still looking for the best method to handle the height of the app, so that it fills the entire screen without scrollbars. I used margins for this project, which works for some heights but not when the screen height exceeds the height of the entire app.
